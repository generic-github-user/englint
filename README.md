# englint

A bold attempt to codify some of my personal stylistic preferences for English
writing and provide automated tools for continuously revising content. It is
designed primarily with technical blogs, documentation, aand similar types of
content in mind but could conceivably be used in other settings. This will be
of limited utility to others, but you are welcome to try it.

## Conventions

- The Oxford comma should be included in lists if at all possible
- Semicolons and colons should generally only be used once per sentence
- Combined use of em dashes and semicolons should be limited
- Avoid double spaces

## Style

- Paragraphs should generally be limited to ~300 words and ~10 sentences
- Non-technical words or phrases should not be used more than once in the same sentence (excepting parallel structure and similar intentional uses)
- The decision of whether to use date suffixes (e.g., July 13th) should be consistent across a document or project
- Sentences should generally be limited to ~50 words
- Em dash usage should be limited to once per paragraph or less, on average
- Use of expletives should be limited (context-dependent)
- Parentheticals longer than ~30 words should be converted to footnotes
- "etc." should typically only be used after lists containing >1 item
- Titles/headings should be consistent in their capitalization
- Parentheticals should be limited to 2 per sentence and occur in fewer than one-third of sentences on average
- Use of "&" and "and" should be consistent
- Use of "I" should be limited
- Sentences should not start with "and", "or", or "so"
- Numeric form should be used for numbers above 20, excepting those divisible by 10, 100, 1000, etc. (refer to the AP Stylebook for circumstances in which numerals should always be used)
- The passive voice should be avoided; prefer the active voice
