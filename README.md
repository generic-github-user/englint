A bold attempt to codify some of my personal stylistic preferences for English
writing and provide automated tools for continuously revising content. It is
designed primarily with technical blogs, documentation, aand similar types of
content in mind but could conceivably be used in other settings. This will be
of limited utility to others, but you are welcome to try it.
